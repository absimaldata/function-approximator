# n-dimensional Polynomial function Approximator using Deep leaning methods.

Model Architechture:

n input layer (currently tested on X and Y inputs)
4 hidden layers consisting of only 10 neurons each.
and 1 output (z value)

I used incremental learning rate to approximate a given function using a very basic neural network model built in Keras.

Loss function Mean Absolute Percentage Error outperformed MSE function, as there are high chances of gradient explosion in MSE.

Right now constrained to take positive inputs only, can be extended further with the help of Complex Valued Neural Network models.

Work in Progress...
