# 3 dimensional polynomial function Approximator using Deep leaning methods.

Model Architechture

is 2 (x and y inputs)
4 hidden layers consisting of only 10 neurons each.
and 1 output (z value)

This uses incremental learning rate to approximate a given function using a very basic neural network model built in Keras.

Right now constrained to take positive inputs only, can be extended further with the help of Complex Valued Neural Network models.

Work in Progress...
